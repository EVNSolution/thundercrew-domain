# clever-driver-app

Dedicated native mobile app repository for Clever delivery drivers.

## MVP direction

1. Driver selects a supported country and enters the dispatch-registered phone number in national format.
2. Driver confirms the company/shop/route guidance for the assigned work.
3. Driver accepts location-information and personal-information consent.
4. Driver views the route assigned for the current delivery day.

## Platform direction

- iOS and Android native mobile app.
- Expo/React Native is the selected bootstrap stack for the first implementation slice.
- PWA/web is not the primary driver MVP platform because location permissions, foreground/background services, security, and controlled distribution matter for this app.

## Repository boundaries

- `clever-delivery-server` is the source of truth for companies/shops, drivers, routes, orders, assignments, consent records, and location/compliance logs.
- This repository owns the driver-facing mobile UX, runtime, local verification, and mobile release evidence.
- Phone number alone must not be treated as a global driver identity; route/company context is part of the access boundary.

## Current app flow

The app includes an interactive route access screen:

- country-aware phone entry with a broad supported-country catalog, locale/language/culture metadata, national display formatting, and E.164 normalization before lookup
- local mock service for delivery-server `POST /driver/route-access/lookup`
- company/shop/route guidance for `INVITED`, plus safe multi-company ambiguity guidance that does not expose route/stop/customer data or driver access tokens
- local proof-media upload smoke selector for success, retryable failure, and scanner rejection while the app is using mock services
- app-side consent gate for required location-information and personal-information consent
- local mock service and API client boundary for delivery-server `POST /driver/consents`
- driver access token parsing from route lookup and API-client handoff helper
- assigned route mock/API boundary for delivery-server `GET /driver/assigned-route`
- route summary, ordered stop cards, and OS map handoff after consent moves the flow to `route_ready`
- explicit delivery start action that requests OS foreground location permission before `delivery_active`
- route started, foreground one-shot location update, continuous background-capable location streaming, native proof photo URI capture, proof media upload references, scanner-rejected proof photo recapture guidance, signature/barcode proof capture, richer stop delivered/failed proof-event mock/API boundaries, and route-completed delivery finish cleanup for delivery-server `POST /driver/events` after delivery_active succeeds
- safe denial messages for `NOT_FOUND`, `DISABLED`, and `BLOCKED`
- live `EXPO_PUBLIC_DELIVERY_SERVER_BASE_URL` switch for route lookup, native secure storage for the short-lived driver token, live downstream consent/assigned-route/driver-event/proof-media clients with no-store/no-cookie request options, and live `401` recovery that clears the active driver token and returns the driver to country-aware phone lookup; durable app-side offline queue/retry for pending driver events and proof media using AsyncStorage-backed non-secret queue metadata, with app-side discard thresholds for repeated failure, stale age, recorded route completion cleanup, explicit scanner-rejected proof media discard/recapture handling, and an explicit driver session reset action that clears secure access plus queued retry state; delivery-server local/manual proof-media cleanup support and server-side scan rejection hook; production proof-media object storage, signed access, deployed scanner evidence, deployed cleanup evidence, physical-device smoke evidence, and store/privacy disclosure evidence left for follow-up slices

See `docs/route-access-flow.md` for the app-side route access, consent, assigned-route, native map handoff, and delivery evidence boundary.


## Repository guardrails

- Human contribution workflow is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Security/privacy reporting and evidence handling are documented in `SECURITY.md`.
- Production release, store disclosure, and physical-device smoke evidence are tracked in `docs/release-readiness.md`.
- `.editorconfig` fixes UTF-8/LF/two-space defaults for reviewed source/docs files; `.gitattributes` normalizes source-controlled text and keeps evidence/release/signing artifacts binary if an owner-approved exception ever appears.
- A public `LICENSE` file has not been selected yet; do not add reuse terms without an explicit owner decision.

## Local setup

Recommended Node baseline is recorded in `.nvmrc` and matches the Expo SDK 54 minimum Node floor used by this bootstrap.

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run start
```

Optional live API mode (route lookup saves the returned short-lived driver token through Expo SecureStore, clears expired/invalid persisted tokens before reuse, and clears live downstream `401` tokens before requiring country-aware phone lookup again; see `.env.example`):

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_DELIVERY_SERVER_BASE_URL=https://delivery.example.com npm run start
```

Native launch helpers:

```bash
npm run ios
npm run android
```

## Verification commands

```bash
npm run check:workspace
npm run check:source-layout
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run check:native-release
npm run release:evidence:seed
npm run build
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
npx expo install --check
git diff --check
```

GitHub Actions runs the PR/push subset in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for
`dev` and `main`: dependency install, workspace checks, lint, native release
preflight, non-secret release evidence seed rendering, app bundle export, npm
audit, Expo dependency alignment, and diff whitespace checks. CI does not run
EAS binary builds and does not replace Apple/Google signing, store/private
distribution approval, privacy/legal approval, or physical-device smoke evidence.

`npm run build` exports Android and iOS JavaScript bundles into ignored `dist/` folders. It is not an App Store/Play Store binary build. Native binary candidates are described by `eas.json`:

```bash
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
npx eas-cli build --platform ios --profile preview
npx eas-cli build --platform all --profile production
```

Run `npm run check:native-release` before EAS builds or release PRs. It validates source-controlled Expo/EAS identity, permission, profile, and public runtime env baseline only; owner-controlled Expo/EAS project values, Apple/Google signing authority, store/private distribution approval, privacy copy, and license decisions remain external release blockers.

Run `npm run release:evidence:seed` from the committed source revision selected for EAS/device testing. It prints a non-secret Markdown seed with commit, app version/build identifiers, EAS build commands, preflight status, external blocker list, and tracking issues so the completed evidence manifest can be filled in the approved external evidence store.

After the copied external manifest has real EAS URLs/references, iPhone and
Android physical-device results, and owner/legal approvals, validate a local
working copy before the release decision:

```bash
npm run release:evidence:verify -- /path/to/external/release-evidence-manifest-<date>-<sha>.md
```

The verifier rejects remaining `pending` placeholders, missing device/store
approval rows, a non-`approved` release decision, and common sensitive or binary
artifact patterns. It does not replace real external evidence collection, owner
approval, or the rule that completed manifests stay out of git.

Preview builds are for internal physical-device evidence collection. Production builds are store/TestFlight/Play candidates and require owner-controlled Expo, Apple, Google, signing, and environment-variable setup before execution.

Before opening a PR, confirm the branch is issue-linked, the PR targets `dev`,
generated outputs and physical-device evidence artifacts remain ignored,
completed release evidence manifests, screenshots, videos, logs, app binaries,
and signing material stay outside git, `.env.example` still documents every
public runtime env key used by the app, and `npm run check:native-release`
passes for release-sensitive config changes.
