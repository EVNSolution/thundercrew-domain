# Clever Driver release evidence manifest template

## Use and storage rules

Copy this template into the approved external release evidence store for each
preview or production release candidate. Do not commit completed manifests,
screenshots, videos, EAS artifacts, signing files, production logs, real driver
phone numbers, customer PII, exact production coordinates, access tokens, or
store-console screenshots to this repository.

Recommended external filename:

```text
release-evidence-manifest-<yyyyMMdd>-<shortsha>.md
```

Before filling a copied manifest, run `npm run release:evidence:seed` from the
committed source revision and paste its non-secret output into the external
evidence workspace as the starting audit record. The seed does not replace real
EAS build URLs, physical-device results, or owner/legal approvals.

After filling the external copy, validate a local working copy from this repo:

```bash
npm run release:evidence:verify -- /path/to/external/release-evidence-manifest-<yyyyMMdd>-<shortsha>.md
```

The verifier should pass only after all `pending` placeholders are removed, each
physical-device smoke row has iPhone and Android `pass` results with sanitized
external evidence references, each store/privacy row is approved or complete,
and the release candidate decision is `approved`. Do not commit the completed
copy after verification.
