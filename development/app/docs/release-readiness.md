# Release readiness checklist

## Purpose

This document tracks the non-code evidence needed before a production iOS/Android release of `clever-driver-app`. Product scope remains in `docs/project-brief.md`; app-side API/runtime behavior remains in `docs/route-access-flow.md`.

## Distribution decision

The app targets native iPhone and Android phone runtime. `eas.json` now defines build-profile scaffolding, but the final release channel is still pending owner decision:

- App Store/TestFlight and Google Play testing or production tracks
- Apple Business Manager Custom Apps and managed Google Play/private app for restricted driver distribution

Do not add final store listing copy, screenshots, signing ownership, or public license terms without an explicit owner decision. `docs/store-privacy-disclosure-draft.md` is a non-final worksheet for owner/legal review only.

## Native build profile matrix

The native binary build path uses Expo EAS profiles:

| Profile | Command | Intended evidence | Owner-controlled prerequisites |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preview` Android | `npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview` | Internal `.apk` install for Android physical-device smoke | Expo account/project access, EAS `preview` environment values, device/tester distribution decision |
| `preview` iOS | `npx eas-cli build --platform ios --profile preview` | Internal iPhone smoke build through EAS internal distribution | Expo account/project access, Apple team/signing authority, registered devices or approved internal distribution path, EAS `preview` environment values |
| `production` all | `npx eas-cli build --platform all --profile production` | Store/TestFlight/Play candidate archives | Expo account/project access, Apple/Google store authority, production signing, EAS `production` environment values, approved privacy/store copy |

`cli.requireCommit` is enabled in `eas.json` so native evidence builds are tied to committed source. `cli.appVersionSource` is `remote`; initial local `ios.buildNumber` and `android.versionCode` are set to `1` before the first EAS remote version sync, while production builds use `autoIncrement` to avoid duplicate store build numbers.

Before running any preview/production EAS build for evidence, run:

```bash
npm run check:native-release
```

This local preflight validates source-controlled Expo/EAS identity, native permission declarations, build-profile shape, and public runtime env documentation. It is not a substitute for owner-controlled Expo/EAS project setup, signing authority, store/private distribution decisions, privacy disclosure approval, public license approval, or physical-device smoke evidence.

After choosing the committed source revision for external EAS/device evidence,
seed the external evidence manifest with:

```bash
npm run release:evidence:seed
```

The command prints non-secret Markdown with the current commit/ref, app
version/build identifiers, EAS build commands, native release preflight result,
remaining owner-controlled gates, and release blocker issue map. Copy that
output into the approved external evidence store before filling EAS URLs, device
results, owner/legal approvals, and evidence references. Do not commit completed
manifests or binary artifacts.

After the external manifest is filled, validate a local working copy before the
release decision:

```bash
npm run release:evidence:verify -- /path/to/external/release-evidence-manifest-<date>-<sha>.md
```

The verifier is intentionally secret-free and read-only: it checks for remaining
`pending` placeholders, required iPhone/Android smoke evidence rows,
store/privacy approvals, an `approved` release decision, and common sensitive or
binary artifact patterns. It does not prove that external screenshots, videos,
store-console records, signing authority, or owner/legal approvals are genuine;
those remain owner-controlled release gates.

## Physical-device smoke matrix

Before production release, capture evidence on at least one real iPhone and one real Android phone. Use synthetic driver/route data unless production validation is explicitly approved. Execute `docs/physical-device-smoke-runbook.md` for the step order, evidence naming, and external storage rules. Copy `docs/release-evidence-manifest.template.md` into the external evidence store for the release candidate and fill it there; do not commit completed evidence manifests.

| Area | iPhone evidence | Android evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh install and app launch | pending | pending | Include app version/build identifier. |
| E.164 phone lookup | pending | pending | Verify tenant/company context before route data. |
| Company guidance and support contact display | pending | pending | Confirm multi-company wording. |
| Consent gate and retry/error handling | pending | pending | Verify consent versions/copy source. |
| Assigned route and stop list | pending | pending | Use shop/route timezone `deliveryDate`. |
| Stop-card OS map handoff | pending | pending | Confirm coordinates open the expected native map app and address fallback works for stops without coordinates. |
| Delivery start foreground location permission | pending | pending | Confirm denial and recovery UX. |
| Continuous/background-capable location task | pending | pending | Confirm native background configuration and OS prompts. |
| Proof photo capture from camera/library | pending | pending | Use synthetic proof media. |
| Proof media scan rejection UX | pending | pending | Local mock mode now exposes `scan_rejected`; live mode can use server `PROOF_MEDIA_REJECTED`. Confirm rejected photos show recapture guidance and are not queued as retryable proof. |
| Signature and barcode proof capture | pending | pending | Confirm unavailable/denied states. |
| Offline queue retry/discard UI after network loss | pending | pending | Confirm app restart hydration. |
| Token expiry, invalid persisted token, or live downstream `401` recovery | pending | pending | App clears expired/malformed SecureStore payloads before reuse and live downstream `401` driver access plus active route UI state before requiring phone lookup re-lookup; confirm on devices. |
| Driver session reset/sign-out cleanup | pending | pending | Confirm reset stops tracking, clears SecureStore driver access, clears queued retry state, blanks lookup inputs, and returns to safe lookup state. |
| Delivery finish or route completion cleanup | pending | pending | App-side finish now stops tracking, records/queues `ROUTE_COMPLETED`, and cleans route queue after recorded completion; confirm on devices. |

## Store and privacy disclosure checklist

Store/privacy metadata must match actual runtime behavior and server retention policy before release:

- Foreground location use: active delivery route tracking and location updates.
- Background location use: only after delivery start and only when native background tracking is enabled.
- Camera/photos: proof-of-delivery photo capture/upload.
- Camera barcode scanning: proof barcode capture when available.
- Contacts/address book: current app uses manual E.164 phone entry and should not request Contacts permissions unless a future owner-approved feature changes that. `npm run check:native-release` rejects source-controlled Android Contacts permissions or iOS Contacts usage descriptions before EAS evidence builds.
- Driver identifiers: phone lookup, server-issued driver access token, route assignment identifiers.
- Proof media: photo file, signature metadata, barcode metadata, and related stop/route identifiers.
- Offline queue: non-secret retry metadata and file URI references retained locally until retry/discard policy runs.
- Offline queue app-side policy: pending driver event/proof-media retry items are discarded after five retained attempts, after 72 hours, when the completed route is explicitly purged, when driver sign-out/session reset clears local retry state, or when proof-media upload is rejected by the server scan hook.
- Server proof-media rejection/retention support: `clever-delivery-server` now has a proof-media scan rejection hook, `DRIVER_PROOF_MEDIA_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `npm run driver:proof-media:cleanup` for local/manual or cron-style cleanup; production object storage, scanner backend, and scheduler deployment evidence are still pending.
- Support contact: company/operator support contact must be available in route guidance or store support metadata.

See `docs/store-privacy-disclosure-draft.md` for the current non-final App Store / Google Play disclosure worksheet. The worksheet narrows the review input, including current Google Play minimum-scope permission caveats for location, photo/video, and Contacts permissions, but final store answers still require owner/legal approval in the actual store consoles.

## Evidence storage policy

- Keep screenshots/videos/logs in the approved external evidence location; issues and PRs should contain only sanitized references.
- Do not commit large binary evidence, generated app bundles, signing artifacts, or production PII to this repo.
- If an evidence artifact is necessary but sensitive, reference the private storage location in the change-control issue instead of committing it.
- Completed copies of `docs/release-evidence-manifest.template.md` belong in the external evidence store, not in git.
- Run `npm run release:evidence:verify -- <external-manifest-path>` against a local copy before marking the release candidate approved, then keep only the verifier result and sanitized evidence references in issues/PRs.

## Release blockers still open

These blockers are now tracked as GitHub issues so release evidence can refer to
stable work items instead of unowned notes:

| Blocker | Tracking issue | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical iOS/Android device smoke evidence for background tracking, proof capture, offline retry/discard, token recovery, and route completion cleanup | EVNSolution/clever-driver-app#72 | Driver app evidence collection |
| Owner-controlled Expo/EAS project, Apple/Google signing credentials, EAS preview/production environment values, store/private distribution policy, owner/legal-approved privacy disclosure copy, and public license/reuse decision | EVNSolution/clever-driver-app#73 | Native build/distribution approval |
| Production proof-media object storage ownership, signed retrieval/access-control, scanner backend/private evidence storage, and deployed cleanup/scheduler evidence | EVNSolution/clever-delivery-server#71 | Delivery-server proof media hardening |

The baseline context-monorepo service pointer is complete:
`EVNSolution/clever-context-monorepo#23` was closed by
`EVNSolution/clever-context-monorepo#24`. Future production runtime/API
boundary changes should create a new context-monorepo issue/PR only if the
durable service responsibility, public contract, deployment/runtime category, or
cross-repo interpretation changes.
